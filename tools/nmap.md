# Nmap

Nmap really one of the goats.  Absolutely still use this for almost every CTF, Bug Bounty, Pentest, etc.. and pretty much right away.  If you're not using the NSE scripts deeply and often, you aren't using it beyond 15%  of its awesome potential, so take the deep dive and take it right now.    
  
Here's a handful of web app scripts:

Kinda went overboard with this list but here are my favorite NSE scripts for bug bounty \(and I guess anything really\).
